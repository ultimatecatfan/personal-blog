  "body": "Being a naturally curious person, I thrive in nurturing environments that allow me to learn at my own pace. \n     I can be seen either clutching a book, learning new technology skills, or reading about global affairs. I possess a good work ethic and valuable skills ranging from various programming languages and data analysis and web development skills to legal analysis and writing skills. \n     I am currently learning Javascript, Pandas, and Intellectual Property Law. Having an innate sense of justice, I am highly concerned with issues of global humanitarian concern and enjoy helping the disadvantaged and voiceless. \n     Tune in to this blog to follow my journey for knowledge.",
